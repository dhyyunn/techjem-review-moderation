"This guy really know how to cut hair. This used to be Pat's Barber Shop, if this is the location I think I'm reviewing. I've only ever seen one guy working here and he is the bomb! He doesn't talk much, but that's not what I want anyway when I come for a haircut. I want a quality haircut and beard trim, and this guy delivers both for a $20 bill. I can tell how meticulously he works his instruments. I get a different haircut and beard trim every time, and every time, it's jaw-dropping! Once you go to a quality barber, you won't go back to Great Clips. P.S. don't come here in a rush. He takes his time with each of his customers, which I like, and doesn't seem to rush a haircut in any way when customers are waiting. Come here on a day off.

"Great place to eat, I think of it as the Subway of Mexican food, I usually go with a burrito and because you tell them what you want every step of the way, the burrito is always great. Never had a burrito there that I didn't like. I always ask for their spicy sauce cause that's how I like it but the beans and cheese and meat are always fresh and hot so you could do just fine with a normal bean and cheese or whatever. Try them out, I doubt you will regret it. Downsides? Sometimes the lines are long and of course burritos can give indigestion in some.
